// ---------- PASSAGE 1: "The rise of the urban vegetable garden" ------------
const p1Body = `
<p><span class="para-label">A</span>Urban vegetable gardens, once a rarity in industrialised cities, have become a defining feature of twenty-first-century metropolitan life. From rooftops in Singapore to reclaimed railway sidings in Berlin, residents are increasingly turning unused spaces into productive plots. Historians trace the modern movement back to the "victory gardens" of the World Wars, when citizens were encouraged to grow food on any available patch of land. However, today's revival is driven by a different set of concerns: food miles, climate resilience, and a renewed appreciation for the social value of shared green spaces.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">B</span>A 2018 survey of twelve European capitals found that the number of registered community gardens had more than tripled between 2005 and 2017. Municipal planners in cities such as Paris and Copenhagen now routinely incorporate edible landscaping into new developments. The trend is driven in part by younger residents, many of whom lack access to private outdoor space, but it also reflects broader demographic shifts: an ageing population looking for low-impact outdoor activity and a growing immigrant population bringing diverse horticultural traditions.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">C</span>The environmental case is compelling. A single community plot of 100 square metres can, according to researchers at Delft University, absorb approximately 350 kilograms of carbon dioxide per year through photosynthesis, and substantially more when mature fruit trees are included. Soil sealed under concrete is "reactivated" when it is returned to cultivation, improving drainage and reducing the urban heat-island effect. A report from the Rockefeller Foundation in 2020 estimated that widespread urban agriculture could meet up to 15 per cent of the fresh vegetable demand in mid-sized cities — a modest but meaningful contribution.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">D</span>Economic benefits are harder to quantify. Few urban gardens aim to be commercially viable; most operate as not-for-profit cooperatives. Nonetheless, a study led by Dr Helen Markova at the London School of Economics concluded that the social return on investment (SROI) — a measure that assigns monetary value to wellbeing, community cohesion and skills-training — can be as high as £7 for every £1 invested. Markova cautions, however, that these figures are sensitive to the assumptions made about volunteer labour and should be treated as indicative rather than definitive.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">E</span>Not everyone shares the enthusiasm. Some urban economists argue that the opportunity cost of dedicating scarce central land to vegetables is too high in housing-stressed cities. Others point out that community gardens can gentrify neighbourhoods, pushing out the very low-income residents they are often designed to serve. A much-publicised 2019 dispute in Brooklyn, where a long-running garden was replaced by a mixed-income apartment block, became a touchstone in this debate.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">F</span>Technological innovation has also transformed what is possible. Hydroponic and aeroponic systems now allow vegetables to grow vertically in converted warehouses, producing yields per square metre many times greater than traditional farming. Critics observe that such high-tech installations consume significant electricity and are only sustainable where the power grid is itself decarbonising. Simpler innovations — water-efficient drip irrigation, mobile phone apps that coordinate watering rotas, shared tool libraries — may have a larger cumulative impact because they are affordable and widely adopted.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">G</span>What is perhaps most striking is the diversity of motivations reported by urban gardeners themselves. In a 2022 survey of 1,400 plot-holders across eight cities, researchers from Utrecht University found that "growing my own food" ranked only fourth, behind "spending time outdoors", "meeting neighbours" and "teaching my children where food comes from". The future of the movement, the authors argue, lies not in competing with rural agriculture but in reshaping the fabric of city life itself.</p>

// ---------- PASSAGE 2: "The surprising intelligence of octopuses" ----------
const p2Body = `
<h3>The surprising intelligence of octopuses</h3>
<p><span class="para-label">A</span>For centuries the octopus has been regarded by sailors and scientists alike as a creature of brute instinct. Modern research, however, has comprehensively overturned this view. Octopuses routinely solve problems that would tax the capacities of many vertebrates: they open jars to retrieve food, navigate complex mazes, and — as demonstrated by a celebrated series of experiments at the Seattle Aquarium in the early 2010s — remember individual human keepers, behaving warmly towards those who feed them and squirting water at those who have annoyed them.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">B</span>Such cognitive performance is all the more remarkable given how differently the octopus brain is organised. Of the roughly 500 million neurons in a common octopus, only around one-third are located in the central brain. The remainder are distributed through the eight arms, each of which can independently taste, touch and to some extent decide. Neuroscientist Dr Binyamin Hochner, whose laboratory in Jerusalem has pioneered work in this area, describes the octopus as "a distributed cognition machine" whose arms possess a form of autonomy that has no direct parallel in mammals.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">C</span>The evolutionary history underlying this anatomy is extraordinary. Cephalopods and vertebrates diverged more than 500 million years ago, and their complex nervous systems evolved entirely independently. Yet both lineages converged on many of the same "advanced" behaviours: tool use, play, long-term memory, and personality differences between individuals. For biologists, the octopus therefore represents a natural experiment in what intelligence can look like when it evolves along an alternative path.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">D</span>One long-standing puzzle is why octopuses should be smart at all. Social learning is widely thought to drive the evolution of intelligence, and yet octopuses are largely solitary, living only one to three years and usually dying shortly after their first reproduction. Dr Jennifer Mather of the University of Lethbridge has argued that the relevant pressures in octopuses may be ecological rather than social: a life in complex reef environments full of shifting predators and prey would place a premium on flexibility and rapid learning.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">E</span>Evidence for tool use is particularly striking. Off the coast of Indonesia, the veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) has been filmed gathering the two halves of discarded coconut shells, carrying them beneath its body across the seafloor, and later reassembling them to form a mobile shelter. Sceptics initially dismissed this as opportunism, but subsequent analyses have shown that the animals actively choose suitable shells and transport them significant distances — classic criteria for tool use as opposed to mere object manipulation.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">F</span>Captive studies have also revealed apparently playful behaviour. When given floating pill bottles in aquarium tanks, several octopuses have been observed blowing jets of water to push the bottles across the surface and waiting for the current to bring them back — a pattern repeated consistently and without any obvious reward. Mather and colleague Roland Anderson have taken this as evidence that octopuses, like parrots and dolphins, engage in "object play" that meets formal definitions of the term.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">G</span>These findings raise pressing ethical questions. In 2021 the United Kingdom formally recognised cephalopods as sentient beings under its Animal Welfare Act, a change prompted in part by a comprehensive review led by the London School of Economics. Proposed commercial octopus farms, particularly a large facility planned for the Canary Islands, have become a flashpoint for debate. Animal welfare groups argue that intensive confinement is incompatible with what is now known about octopus cognition; industry representatives counter that aquaculture could reduce pressure on wild stocks. The argument is unlikely to be settled soon.</p>

// ---------- PASSAGE 3: "Why we remember what we forget" -------------------
const p3Body = `
<h3>Why we remember what we forget</h3>
<p><span class="para-label">A</span>Memory research has long been preoccupied with what people remember and how accurately. Over the last two decades, however, a growing body of work has turned its attention to the opposite question: what, and why, do we forget? The emerging consensus is surprising. Forgetting is not, as nineteenth-century psychologists often assumed, a simple decay or failure of the memory system. It is, increasingly, understood as an active, adaptive process whose proper functioning may be as important to cognition as remembering itself.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">B</span>Classical theories dating back to Ebbinghaus in 1885 modelled memory loss as a smooth "forgetting curve", with information fading predictably over time. Such models still dominate textbooks, but they fit laboratory data better than they do real life. Modern experiments using neuroimaging and carefully designed behavioural tasks have shown that forgetting is highly selective. Unhelpful, outdated or irrelevant information is preferentially discarded, while material that supports current goals is reinforced. Far from being a bug in the system, forgetting looks increasingly like a feature.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">C</span>One of the clearest demonstrations came from a 2017 study at the University of Toronto, in which participants learned two overlapping sets of vocabulary. When later asked to recall one set, they actively suppressed the other — an effect visible in fMRI scans as reduced activity in memory-associated regions. The lead researcher, Dr Priya Rajavelu, argues that the brain is constantly performing a form of cognitive housekeeping, pruning information that would otherwise interfere with ongoing tasks.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">D</span>The adaptive view has important clinical implications. People with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) often suffer not because they cannot remember, but because they cannot forget: intrusive, vivid memories are repeatedly reactivated. New therapies based on "memory reconsolidation" aim to weaken such memories by reactivating them in controlled settings and then interrupting the biochemical processes that would normally re-store them. Early trials have been promising, though the long-term efficacy remains contested.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">E</span>There is also a striking connection to sleep. While awake, the brain is biased towards encoding; while asleep — especially during slow-wave sleep — it selectively prunes less useful connections. Experiments in mice, and increasingly in humans, show that synapses formed during the day shrink overnight in precisely the locations that are no longer relevant to learned behaviours. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have described this as "synaptic homeostasis": sleep resets the brain so that it can absorb new material the following day without becoming saturated.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">F</span>Not all forgetting is benign, of course. The boundary between healthy pruning and pathological loss, as seen in dementia, is still poorly understood. What is clear is that the biological machinery is similar; the difference lies in its regulation. Drugs that enhance memory by preventing forgetting — so-called "nootropics" — have become popular in some student communities, but neuroscientists warn that tampering with the brain's forgetting machinery may have unintended consequences, such as impaired decision-making or heightened anxiety.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">G</span>Philosophers and ethicists have entered the debate too. If forgetting is an integral part of identity, should we pursue technologies that minimise it? In his 2020 book <em>The Art of Forgetting</em>, Professor Marcus Arneson argues that a life in which everything is remembered would be not richer but poorer, because the narrative coherence of a self depends on the selective retention of meaningful experience. He contends, provocatively, that the ability to forget is one of the foundations of being able to forgive.</p>
<p><span class="para-label">H</span>Whether or not one accepts Arneson's stronger claims, the science is clear: forgetting is not the enemy of memory. It is its necessary companion. As researchers continue to map the mechanisms of selective forgetting, what was once seen as a deficiency of the ageing brain is being reinterpreted as one of its most sophisticated achievements.</p>
